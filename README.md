# Botivate: Agentic Minutes of Meeting (MOM) System

![Botivate Logo](frontend/public/botivate-logo-cropped.png)

Botivate is an intelligent, agentic system designed to autonomously handle, analyze, and document your meeting minutes on autopilot. By leveraging cutting-edge AI capabilities (OpenAI and AssemblyAI), Botivate transforms unstructured meeting interactions into highly structured, actionable intelligence, now fully integrated with Google Workspace for seamless enterprise cloud storage.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Agentic Summarization:** The system autonomously drafts MOMs (Minutes of Meeting), identifies key topics, and maps conversations to specific agendas using advanced LangChain LLM pipelines.
- **Flawless Speech-to-Text:** Uses AssemblyAI Cloud STT for highly accurate multilingual transcription (Hindi, English, Hinglish).
- **Intelligent Task Extraction:** Action items are automatically isolated, categorized, and assigned to respective owners without manual intervention.
- **Google Cloud Integration:** Full archival system using **Google Sheets** as a comprehensive database and **Google Drive** for secure document storage.
- **Board Resolution (BR) Management:** Specialized workflow for high-stakes resolutions with meeting-specific folder archival and governance evidence tracking.
- **Automated Notifications:** Botivate automatically sends professional summary emails, task assignments, and overdue warnings with dynamically generated, meticulously styled **PDF attachments**.
- **Rich Analytics Dashboard:** Gain deep insights into team productivity, meeting frequency trends, attendance rates, and action-item completion metrics.
- **Modern & Premium UI:** Designed with a sleek, minimalist dark/light mode interface characterized by glassmorphism, dynamic animations, and brand-consistent styling.
